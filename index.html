        <p>
          I'm an <strong>engineer</strong> turned <strong>data analyst</strong> turned <strong>analytics developer</strong>. After living in 4 different cities I'm currently settled in Vancouver Canada while working for  <strong>Unbounce</strong>. I made the switch from telecom to <strong>SaaS</strong> over 2 years ago
          and it's been an incredible ride. These are exciting times, we're able to provide instantaneous software access to users and collect
          real-time behavior and usage data to evolve the product and better meet users' needs. This potential is what got me hooked on software data. Next to my need to create <strong>data stories</strong>, I have a passion for going to places I've never been before and taking
          an unnecessary amount of photos. I've been in <strong>10 countries</strong> over the past 3 years and still powering through my bucket list.
          Oh and I have an unhealthy obsession with <strong>waterfalls</strong>...

            in mind, for the rest of this application, I'm going to explain why I want to work for Buffer, why this position is the right
            fit for me and why you guys should give me a shot at it.

              The factors that affect how attached an employee is to their company differs from one person to the other.
              The people I work with is one of the most important factors for me, that's something that's hard to gauge while
              applying for a job but I started by reading the <a href="https://buffer.com/about/team" target="_blank">team page</a> and I pretty quickly
              noticed the incredible positivity and diversity. the word "people" and "team" kept coming up a lot,
              I wanted to make sure I'm not imagining it so I did a quick word cloud and turns out I wasn't.

              improvement it can have on my work-life balance. I'm looking to fully buy into it and buffer is the perfect environment
              to take on that challenge in.

            You're inspiring by experimenting. Setting the new standards and sharing your knowledge with the world. The captivating thing
            is how it's engraved in your values, on your about-us page and on the hiring page. You're dedicated
            to challenging the Status Quo. I have a fear of heights but that doesn't stop me from standing near a cliff, I like making myself uncomfortable and
            pushing through limits previously untouched. It's how I get inspired, what you're doing is a rare find and I want to have that

            That's right, every single person in my family is an engineer. Our dinner conversations

            Churn Taskforce, Agency Taskforce and Product. I've come very familiar with the SaaS space, its metrics and have been heavily using SaaS products
            on a daily basis. Growing with Unbounce from 35 employees to over a hundred was a priceless experience, it wasn't just about
            analyzing data but training the data consumers in the company as well and building a strong data-driven culture in the company. A tough problem
            to solve but we've definitely made a lot of progress.

            I've been adamant on picking up whatever is needed to perform the job in the most
            efficient way. I worked heavily with multiple BI tools similar to Looker so the transition should be smooth. I aspire to be a generalist and
            I've been lucky enough to work on diverse projects from pricing, churn, feature adoption, user personas, roadmap planning, upselling, Customer Success performance to
            growing the data warehouse, web events tracking, 3rd party tools integrations and event bus. Through out these projects I was exposed to lots of tools some

            A data story at the end of the day answers a question. A question that will help determine how the product develops,
            how to talk to customers or whether what you've been building is what customers actually needed. Working with data helps me help everyone venture into the unknown and be comfortable making their decisions now that they're data-driven or data-informed. I get to explore and play around with the question or the problem as if it's a puzzle, the more unknowns the more complicated/fun it is.
